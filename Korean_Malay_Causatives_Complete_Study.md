## 1. Introduction

Morphological causatives are linguistic constructions that express causal relationships between two events, where one event (the cause) brings about another event (the result). Understanding these constructions is crucial for:

- Revealing syntactic and semantic frameworks of different languages
- Understanding cognitive processes in language comprehension
- Improving cross-cultural communication in multilingual environments
- Designing effective language learning strategies

### Research Objectives:

1. Provide detailed explanation of Malay causative types
2. Conduct contrastive analysis with Korean morphological causatives
3. Examine productivity and constraints of causative formations
4. Explore implications for working space design

## 2. Theoretical Background

### Types of Causatives

#### 2.1 Lexical Causatives
- Causative meaning embedded in verb's core meaning
- No additional affixation required
- Examples: kill (vs. die), membunuh (vs. mati)

#### 2.2 Morphological Causatives
- Formed by adding morphemes to non-causative verb stems
- Changes argument structure of the verb
- Examples: Korean 먹다→먹이다, Malay tidur→menidurkan

#### 2.3 Periphrastic Causatives
- Use separate words (auxiliary verbs) to express causation
- More complex syntactic structures
- Examples: English "make/let", Korean "-게 하다", Malay "suruh"

## 3. Korean Morphological Causatives

### Characteristics:

1. **Low Productivity**
   - Seven suffixes: -이, -히, -리, -기, -우, -구, -추
   - Unpredictable distribution
   - Limited to specific verbs

2. **Strong Lexical Constraint**
   - Suffix selection determined by individual verb properties
   - Not predictable based on general rules
   - Requires memorization

3. **Semantic Flexibility**
   - Single form can express multiple meanings
   - Example: 먹이다 (to feed/to raise)

### Examples:

| Base Form | Causative | Translation | Suffix |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| 먹다 | 먹이다 | eat → feed | -이 |
| 앉다 | 앉히다 | sit → seat | -히 |
| 울다 | 울리다 | cry → make cry | -리 |
| 신다 | 신기다 | wear → make wear | -기 |
| 자다 | 재우다 | sleep → put to sleep | -우 |
| 솟다 | 솟구다 | rise → make rise | -구 |
| 맞다 | 맞추다 | fit → adjust | -추 |

## 4. Malay Causatives (Detailed Analysis)

### 4.1 Lexical Causatives

#### Definition:
Verbs that inherently express causation without morphological modification.

#### Characteristics:
- Causative meaning embedded in verb's core semantics
- No additional affixation required
- Often paired with non-causative counterparts

#### Examples:

| Causative | Non-causative | Translation |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| membunuh | mati | kill vs. die |
| memecahkan | pecah | break (tr.) vs. break (intr.) |
| menumbuhkan | tumbuh | grow (tr.) vs. grow (intr.) |

### 4.2 Morphological Causatives

#### The meN-...-kan Construction

The most systematic and productive causative construction in Malay.

#### Phonological Variations:

| Prefix Form | Environment | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| me- | Before l, r, m, w, y | melawat |
| mem- | Before b, p, f | membuat |
| men- | Before c, j, d, t, z | menulis |
| meng- | Before vowels, g, k | mengajar |
| meny- | Before s, sy | menyebabkan |
| menge- | Monosyllabic roots | mengebom |

#### High Productivity Features:

1. **Predictable Formation**: Systematic phonological rules
2. **Broad Applicability**: Works with verbs, adjectives, numerals
3. **Consistent Meaning**: Reliably produces causative meaning

#### Examples:

| Base Form | Causative Form | Translation |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| pakai | memakaikan | wear → dress someone |
| tidur | menidurkan | sleep → put to sleep |
| duduk | mendudukkan | sit → seat someone |
| baca | membacakan | read → read to/for |
| tulis | menuliskan | write → write for |
| satu | menyatukan | one → unite |
| dua | menduakan | two → betray/duplicate |

#### Unique Feature: Application to Numerals

- **menyatukan**: to unite, make into one
- **menduakan**: to betray (relationships), make secondary, associate partners (religious context)

### 4.3 Periphrastic Causatives

#### Definition:
Constructions using separate verbs to express causation.

#### Common Periphrastic Verbs:

1. **suruh** (to order/command)
   - Dia suruh saya pergi (He ordered me to go)
   - Saya suruh dia makan (I ordered him to eat)

2. **buat** (to make/cause)
   - Saya buat dia menangis (I made him cry)
   - Cerita itu buat saya ketawa (That story made me laugh)

3. **bikin** (informal: to make)
   - Dia bikin saya marah (He made me angry)

## 5. Contrastive Analysis

### Similarities:

1. **Functional Equivalence**: Both languages express causation morphologically
2. **Affixation Strategy**: Both use affixes to modify verb meanings
3. **Argument Structure Change**: Causativization increases valency

### Key Differences:

| Feature | Korean | Malay |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Number of markers | 7 suffixes | 1 circumfix (with variants) |
| Predictability | Low (lexically constrained) | High (rule-based) |
| Applicability | Limited to specific verbs | Broad (multiple word classes) |
| Regularity | Irregular | Highly regular |
| Semantic flexibility | High (multiple meanings) | Low (consistent meaning) |

### Visual Analysis:

![Distribution of Causative Types](analysis/causative_comparison.png)
- Korean: Primarily morphological with some periphrastic
- Malay: Balanced distribution across all three types

![Productivity Comparison](analysis/productivity_comparison.png)
- Malay shows significantly higher morphological productivity
- Korean shows lower predictability but greater semantic range

## 6. Implications for Working Space Design

### Cross-Cultural Communication:

1. **Clarity in Instructions**
   - Malay's predictable system facilitates clearer task delegation
   - Korean's flexibility requires more contextual clarification

2. **Documentation Standards**
   - Technical documentation must account for different causative expressions
   - Style guides should address causative usage in bilingual contexts

3. **Interface Design**
   - Command structures in software should consider causative patterns
   - Error messages and instructions need cultural adaptation

### Practical Applications:

1. **Team Collaboration**
   - Awareness of causative differences improves communication efficiency
   - Training programs should address linguistic differences

2. **Project Management**
   - Task assignment language should be culturally appropriate
   - Delegation expressions need careful translation

3. **Design Briefs**
   - Korean contexts may require more detailed specifications
   - Malay contexts benefit from systematic instruction patterns

## 7. Conclusion

This contrastive study reveals fundamental differences in how Korean and Malay express morphological causatives:

### Main Findings:

1. **Malay's Systematic Approach**
   - Single productive circumfix (meN-...-kan)
   - Predictable phonological variations
   - Broad applicability across word classes

2. **Korean's Lexical Approach**
   - Multiple suffixes with limited productivity
   - Unpredictable selection patterns
   - Greater semantic flexibility

3. **Practical Implications**
   - Different strategies needed for language learning
   - Cultural considerations for workplace communication
   - Design implications for multilingual environments

### Future Research Directions:

1. Acquisition patterns of causatives by L2 learners
2. Role of causatives in professional discourse
3. Computational modeling of causative formation
4. Impact on machine translation systems

### Final Remarks:

Understanding these linguistic differences is crucial for effective cross-cultural communication in increasingly globalized workspaces. The systematic nature of Malay causatives contrasts with Korean's lexically-constrained system, each reflecting different cognitive approaches to expressing causation. These insights can inform language pedagogy, interface design, and cross-cultural training programs.
