Detailed Outline for Project Planning Using Clien Extension AI Tools

1. Define Project Scope and Requirements





Objective: Clearly outline what the project aims to achieve and the resources needed.



Steps:





Identify the main goals (e.g., building a web app, automating a process).



List key features and functionalities.



Determine the technology stack (e.g., programming languages, frameworks).



Tools:





Use VS Code’s built-in Task Runner to outline initial tasks (optional).



Leverage Clien Extension’s /newrule to create high-level project guidelines (e.g., "Ensure all code is modular").

2. Set Up Project Structure in VS Code





Objective: Organize your workspace for efficiency and clarity.



Steps:





Create necessary folders (e.g., src, tests, docs).



Initialize configuration files (e.g., .gitignore, package.json).



Set up VS Code settings specific to the project (e.g., editor preferences).



Tools:





Use /newrule to enforce folder structure consistency (e.g., "All source code must be in the src directory").

3. Use /newrule to Establish Coding Standards





Objective: Define and enforce consistent coding practices across the project.



Steps:





Code Formatting:





Set rules for indentation, line length, and spacing (e.g., "Use 2-space indentation").



Enforce consistent use of brackets and semicolons.



Naming Conventions:





Define rules for variable, function, and class names (e.g., "Use camelCase for variables").



Specify naming patterns for files and folders.



Best Practices:





Enforce error handling (e.g., "All functions must handle potential errors").



Set guidelines for logging and debugging.



Security and Performance:





Add rules to avoid common vulnerabilities (e.g., "Sanitize all user inputs").



Encourage performance optimizations (e.g., "Avoid nested loops where possible").



Tools:





Use /newrule to create and enforce these standards (e.g., /newrule "Use const for immutable variables").



Integrate with linters or formatters (e.g., ESLint, Prettier).

4. Configure /newworkflow for Development Tasks





Objective: Automate repetitive tasks to streamline development.



Steps:





Build Workflow:





Create a workflow to compile or build the project (e.g., "Run npm run build").



Test Workflow:





Set up automated testing (e.g., "Run unit tests with jest").



Linting and Formatting:





Automate code linting and formatting before commits (e.g., "Run eslint and prettier").



Deployment Workflow:





(Optional) Set up a workflow for deploying to staging or production.



Tools:





Use /newworkflow to define these automated processes (e.g., /newworkflow "build" "npm run build").



Link workflows to VS Code tasks for easy execution.

5. Integrate with Version Control and CI/CD





Objective: Ensure rules and workflows are enforced throughout the development lifecycle.



Steps:





Git Hooks:





Use pre-commit hooks to run linting, formatting, and tests before allowing commits.



CI/CD Pipelines:





Set up continuous integration to automatically run workflows on each push (e.g., GitHub Actions).



Configure deployment pipelines for automated releases.



Tools:





Use /newworkflow to define tasks that integrate with Git hooks (e.g., /newworkflow "pre-commit" "run lint and tests").



Leverage VS Code extensions like GitLens for version control management.

6. Review and Adjust Rules and Workflows





Objective: Continuously improve the project’s processes based on feedback and evolving needs.



Steps:





Regularly review the effectiveness of rules and workflows with the team.



Adjust or add new rules using /newrule as the project grows (e.g., "Enforce code reviews for all PRs").



Update workflows with /newworkflow to accommodate new tools or processes.



Tools:





Use VS Code’s terminal or task runner to test and refine workflows.



Document all rules and workflows in a README.md or wiki for team reference.



Key Considerations





Documentation: Ensure all rules and workflows are well-documented for team consistency.



Flexibility: Be prepared to adjust rules and workflows as the project evolves.



Automation: Maximize the use of /newworkflow to reduce manual tasks and errors.
