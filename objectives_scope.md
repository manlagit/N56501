# Contrastive Study of Korean and Malay Morphological Causatives

## Objectives

This study aims to:

1. Conduct a comprehensive contrastive analysis of Korean and Malay causatives, with specific focus on explaining Malay causatives across lexical, morphological, and periphrastic types
2. Examine the similarities and differences between Korean and Malay morphological causative constructions
3. Analyze the productivity and lexical constraints of causative formations in both languages
4. Contextualize the findings within working space design and cross-cultural communication contexts

## Scope

### 1. Theoretical Background
- General concept and definition of causatives
- Types of causatives: lexical, morphological, periphrastic
- Cross-linguistic perspectives on causative constructions

### 2. Korean Morphological Causatives
- Causative suffixes: -이, -히, -리, -기, -우, -구, -추
- Formation principles and phonological constraints
- Productivity and lexical restrictions
- Semantic extensions and cultural implications

### 3. Malay Causatives (Detailed Explanation)
#### 4.1 Lexical Causatives
- Inherent causative verbs (e.g., membunuh 'to kill')
- Semantic characteristics and usage patterns

#### 4.2 Morphological Causatives
- The meN-...-kan circumfix construction
- Phonological variations and predictability
- High productivity across word classes
- Application to numerals (satu, dua)

#### 4.3 Periphrastic Causatives
- Syntactic constructions using auxiliary verbs
- Verbs like 'suruh' and 'buat' for causation
- Comparative analysis with Korean -게 하다 construction

### 4. Contrastive Analysis
- Similarities in function and morphological processes
- Differences in:
  - Semantic flexibility
  - Morphological productivity
  - Suffix selection patterns
  - Syntactic alternatives

### 5. Implications for Working Space Design
- How causative complexity affects design communication
- Cross-cultural considerations in collaborative environments
- Practical applications for Korean-Malay bilingual contexts
